%description
This module provides a convenient way to perform cleanup or other forms of
resource management at the end of a scope. It is particularly useful when
dealing with exceptions: the Scope::Guard constructor takes a reference to
a subroutine that is guaranteed to be called even if the thread of
execution is aborted prematurely. This effectively allows lexically-scoped
"promises" to be made that are automatically honoured by perl's garbage
collector.
